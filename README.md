# Synckr Flow Verto

**Synckr Flow Verto** is an adaptive, modular productivity system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It is designed to help users manage tasks, track progress, and boost productivity — all without cost.
The project is divided into multiple smaller modules (minor projects), each handling a specific function, and later integrated into one major application.
